   # Task

   # You have:

   #     a float value that comes from a computation 
   #     and may have accumulated errors 
   #     p to Â±0.001
   #     a reference value

   #     a function approx_equals that compare the two values taking into account 
   #     loss of precision; the function should return True if and only if 
   #     the two values are close to each other, the maximum allowed difference 
   #     is 0.001
   
def approx_equals(a, b):
   # Below you see a function that's given, 
   # but fails on executing the job decently

   # a = round(a, 3)
   # b = round(b, 3)
   # return a == b
   import math
   return math.isclose(a, b, abs_tol = 0.001)
